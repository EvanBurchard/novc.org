Cybernetic ideas
* multi-layer cache (for lookup or forgetting curve) as stream
* Ashby's law of requisite variety as explanatory for oppression
* Compassion and decency as unbounded
* homeostats
* is/can/should : actuality/capability/potentiality : programming(tactical)/planning objectives(strategic)/normative planning
potentiality / actuality = performance
potentiality / capability = latency
capability / actuality = productivity
productivity * latency = performance = potentiality / actuality

* Rhizome as a website
* Mutuality as external links and additional communication layers (contact)
* Unity in diversity (sum and product types)
* View source, maps, isorecursion, and quines
* Isorecursion for caches and researching errors
* Requisite variety/complexity is not handled (people, use cases, and edge cases)
* Homeostats
* Productivity Calculator
* Markov Processes, call sites, monitoring, and eudamonia
* Quality vs. bugs as spontenaity
* Improved theater
* Tracking/finding library sources

## Projects could be in the abstract or for particular purposes

# Why this space?

The tech industry has, for the most part, become a terrible place. This
is a refuge where we examine one core driver of this. Although we
recognize that tech is political, and some of the solutions we need to
build a better world must come from politics, greed has poisoned
everything down to the communication (eg. technical debt) and data structures (eg. the obsession with time complexity).

So while we stand in solidarity with other groups fighting for gender, race, class rights and protections, through electoral strategies and direct action,
the fight in this space targets the technology itself. With humility in
the recognition that a tool or application may already exist, we have no
qualms about making a new one, either to enable redundancy, for training
purposes, or for fun.

Although the core output is improved tools, and an increased familiarity
with them, we don't mind jumping to other areas where we could gather
more information or use our social relations, tools, and knowledge to
help each other or improve some system internal or external.

This follows the current example set by the black socialists, who
believe in reform pending revolution. Our tech scene is deeply broken,
and small fixes are not only immediately useful, but will give big fixes
more of a foothold.

# What is it?
* Is it a bootcamp? No, but it will help you learn crucial and
underemphasized programming skills.

* Is it a guild? No, but it should help you develop your craft for
  practical purposes.

* Is it a social network? No, but it should help you build solidarity
  with people of similar interests.

* Is it a radical collective? Sort of. Most aspects are democratic, and
  all are open to critique and change. But our space is roughly based on
  the idea of a VSM, or "viable systems model" from cybernetics.

* What are the other influences? Currently, the projects, materials,
  and structure are informed by a combination of social ecology and
  cybernetics.

* What is the goal? Explore the realm of potentiality and answer
  collective and individual questions of what we "should" build in order
  to help create the kind of world we want.
