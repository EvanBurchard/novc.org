      <h1>Normative Organization of Viable Cooperation</h1>
      <h2>What is Possible</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Organizations can be structured to tend towards viability, cooperation, sustainability, and justice.</li>
        <li>Politics, social movements, technology, tools, individual actions, conversations, and thoughts are not separate, but mutually reinforcing.</li>
        <li>The best ideas have likely been thoroughly explored within academia, industry, and indigenous knowledge, but may not be understood or popular outside of those contexts.</li>
        <li>Appreciating the ideas within and applied from their contexts facillitates an imaginative, dynamic, and prosperous future.</li>
      </ul>
