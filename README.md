# novc

NOVC is a list of companies that are focused on sustainable growth and a healthy tech ecosystem.

# Why?

Monopolies are good for monopolists and not so much for others.

Also, [this list](https://basecamp.com/bootstrapped) is incredibly important,
but also out of date.

# Requirements for listing your company

For now, just submit a PR and add yourself to the list of companies. If
you're not using a funding model that insists on an unsustainable growth
curve, you're welcome to come aboard.

# Code of Conduct

We'll be using the Contributor Covenent for now.
